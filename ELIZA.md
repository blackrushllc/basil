## ðŸ§  ELIZA Pattern & Reflection Specification

### 1. Reflection pairs

Use these as the default reflection dictionary for `REFLECT$(s$)`:

| Input    | Output   |
| -------- | -------- |
| I        | YOU      |
| ME       | YOU      |
| MY       | YOUR     |
| MINE     | YOURS    |
| AM       | ARE      |
| I'M      | YOU ARE  |
| YOU      | I        |
| YOUR     | MY       |
| YOURS    | MINE     |
| ARE      | AM       |
| MYSELF   | YOURSELF |
| YOURSELF | MYSELF   |

Junie should normalize both keys and tokens to uppercase when reflecting.

### 2. Keyword patterns and example reassemblies

Each **pattern** is checked in priority order.
Each can have several **reassembly templates**, with random choice among them.
Use `<1>`, `<2>`, etc. placeholders for wildcard capture substitution after reflection.

| Pattern        | Example reassemblies                                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `* I FEEL *`   | `WHY DO YOU FEEL <2>?` <br> `DO YOU OFTEN FEEL <2>?` <br> `WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL <2>?`          |
| `* I AM *`     | `HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN <2>?` <br> `WHY DO YOU THINK YOU ARE <2>?`                            |
| `* I * YOU *`  | `DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU <2> ME?` <br> `PERHAPS IN YOUR FANTASIES YOU <2> ME.`                |
| `* YOU * ME *` | `WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I <2> YOU?` <br> `WHY DO YOU BELIEVE I <2> YOU?`                        |
| `* MY *`       | `TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR <2>.` <br> `IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU?`                                 |
| `* BECAUSE *`  | `IS THAT THE REAL REASON?` <br> `DOES THAT EXPLAIN ANYTHING ELSE?`                            |
| `* FAMILY *`   | `TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.`                                                             |
| `* MOTHER *`   | `TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.` <br> `DOES YOUR MOTHER INFLUENCE YOU MUCH?`                 |
| `* FATHER *`   | `TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FATHER.` <br> `DO YOU GET ALONG WITH YOUR FATHER?`                   |
| `* DREAM *`    | `DO YOU OFTEN DREAM <2>?` <br> `WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THE DREAM MEANS?`                         |
| `* FRIEND *`   | `TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS.` <br> `WHY DO YOU MENTION FRIENDS?`                              |
| `* YES *`      | `I SEE.` <br> `PLEASE GO ON.`                                                                 |
| `* NO *`       | `ARE YOU SAYING NO JUST TO BE NEGATIVE?` <br> `WHY NOT?`                                      |
| `* COMPUTER *` | `DO COMPUTERS WORRY YOU?` <br> `DO YOU THINK MACHINES CAN THINK?`                             |
| `* BYE *`      | `GOODBYE. IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU.`                                                        |
| (catch-all)    | `PLEASE TELL ME MORE.` <br> `LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THAT.` <br> `HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?` |

Junie should store these as an in-memory table (array of objects, arrays, or dicts).
Priority: first match in list wins; pick random reassembly among its set.

### 3. Random defaults

Default replies for unmatched inputs:

```
PLEASE TELL ME MORE.
LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THAT.
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
I SEE. GO ON.
DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING SPECIAL TO YOU?
CAN YOU ELABORATE?
DOES THIS HAPPEN OFTEN?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?
INTERESTING. PLEASE CONTINUE.
DO YOU FEEL THAT FREQUENTLY?
```

---

### 4. Example conversation transcript (for validation)

```
ELIZA: HELLO. HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?
YOU: i feel tired
ELIZA: WHY DO YOU FEEL TIRED?
YOU: my job is stressful
ELIZA: TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR JOB.
YOU: because my boss yells
ELIZA: IS THAT THE REAL REASON?
YOU: yes
ELIZA: I SEE.
YOU: bye
ELIZA: GOODBYE. IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU.
```

---

### 5. Implementation guidance for Junie

* All patterns and reflections should be **case-insensitive**.
* Matching engine supports `*` wildcards; captures accessible via `CAPTURE$(n)`.
* Reflection is done **after** wildcard substitution but before printing.
* Preserve simple punctuation in output (`?` and `.` endings from templates).
* Add randomness via `RND%()` for template selection.
