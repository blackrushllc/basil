### Short answer
- I don’t automatically remember past, separate chats. If you start a new task/thread, I won’t recall “Subject A” or “Subject B” unless you bring that context back in.
- If your platform supports a Memory or “pinned” system message for a multi-chat workspace, we can use it. Otherwise, the reliable method is to provide a compact recap at the start of the new chat.

### Why this happens
- Context is per-conversation. When a new thread starts, the prior tokens are not present, so the model has no access to earlier details unless they’re re-supplied (or stored in a dedicated memory feature managed by the app, not the model itself).

### What works well in practice
1) Save a carryover summary at the end of each topic
- At the end of “Subject A” (and later “Subject B”), ask me: “Create a carryover summary for future sessions.”
- I’ll generate a compact, copy-pastable summary you can paste into new chats.

2) Start the next chat with a short Context Pack
- Paste both summaries at the top of your new message when you want to discuss A + B.
- If long, paste only the most recent version or link to a doc that holds them.

3) If your tool supports Memory/Profiles
- Pin your Context Pack in a system/instructions area if available, and update it as things evolve.

### A reusable prompt to get the recap
Copy/paste this at the end of a topic to generate a summary you can reuse later:
```
Please generate a carryover summary for future sessions with the following constraints:
- Length: 200–400 words (tight, scannable).
- Sections: Objective, Decisions Made, Key Artifacts/Links, Constraints/Assumptions, Open Questions/Next Steps, Terminology.
- Tone: neutral, implementation-ready, no fluff.
- Include any canonical definitions, IDs, or file paths we referenced.
- If there were alternative options considered, list them briefly with pros/cons.
```

### A template for your Context Pack (to start future chats)
Paste this at the top of a new chat when you want me to recall multiple subjects:
```
Context Pack (v1.2) — last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

Subject A — Carryover Summary
- Objective: …
- Decisions Made: …
- Key Artifacts/Links: …
- Constraints/Assumptions: …
- Open Questions/Next Steps: …
- Terminology: …

Subject B — Carryover Summary
- Objective: …
- Decisions Made: …
- Key Artifacts/Links: …
- Constraints/Assumptions: …
- Open Questions/Next Steps: …
- Terminology: …

Working Instructions for this Session
- Goals today: …
- What to prioritize: …
- What to ignore: …
- Output format: … (e.g., step-by-step plan, code, table)
```

### Tips to keep it efficient
- Keep it short: 200–400 words per subject is ideal.
- Version your Context Pack: e.g., “v1.2 – added API change on 2025-10-12.”
- Link instead of pasting when content is long (GitHub, Google Doc, Notion). Provide filenames and anchors.
- Use stable identifiers: ticket IDs, branch names, dataset versions, environment names.
- Ask for a delta: “Summarize only what changed since v1.1.”

### Example of a mini carryover summary (format demo)
```
Subject A — Carryover Summary (example)
Objective: Build a minimal CLI tool to convert CSV→JSON.
Decisions: Python 3.12; pandas avoided for size; use argparse; output pretty-printed JSON.
Artifacts: repo: github.com/acme/csv2json, branch: feature/cli, file: src/main.py.
Constraints: Must run in <2s on 50MB CSV; Windows + macOS.
Open Questions: Should we stream rows to reduce memory?
Terminology: “Profile mode” = sampling 1% rows for schema.
```

### How I handle it going forward
- In this chat: I’ll operate only on the context you’ve provided here.
- For future chats: if you paste the carryover summaries (or a link), I’ll be “literate” in Subjects A and B immediately.
- If you’d like, I can help you produce the first carryover summaries now. Tell me the topics and I’ll draft them in the template above.

### Optional: automation ideas
- Maintain a single “Context Pack” document and just paste its latest “Working Instructions” section each session.
- If your workflow allows, keep a pinned system message with the current Context Pack.
- For long-running projects, keep a CHANGELOG-like “Session Log” and ask me to generate a delta summary each time.

If you share brief bullets for Subjects A and B, I’ll generate polished carryover summaries you can reuse for “Subject C” or combined sessions.


> Can I go to a prior chat and ask for a recap to give to the younger chat?

Short answer
Yes. Open the older chat and ask it for a recap/summary you can paste into your new “younger” chat. The older chat remembers its own context, so it can generate an accurate carryover summary. Then paste that summary at the start of the new chat so the assistant becomes “literate” in that topic.

Why this works
Chat memory is per-thread. An older thread can summarize itself well, but a brand‑new thread won’t know anything until you paste the recap in (unless your app has a pinned memory/profile feature).
Step-by-step
Go to the older chat (Subject A or B).
Ask it for a carryover summary (prompt below). It will use the full thread context it still has.
Copy the summary.
Start the new chat and paste the summary at the top, followed by today’s instructions.
Repeat for any other prior threads you want to combine.
A ready-to-use recap prompt (for the older chat)
Please generate a carryover summary for future sessions with the following constraints:
- Length: 200–400 words (tight, scannable).
- Sections: Objective, Decisions Made, Key Artifacts/Links, Constraints/Assumptions, Open Questions/Next Steps, Terminology.
- Tone: neutral, implementation-ready, no fluff.
- Include any canonical definitions, IDs, or file paths we referenced.
- If there were alternative options considered, list them briefly with pros/cons.
  Optional delta (when you already have a previous version)
  Please summarize only what changed since the last summary (v1.1, dated 2025-09-30), keeping to 120–200 words. Use sections: Decisions Changed, New Artifacts/Links, New Constraints, New Open Questions.

[Paste summary here]

Working Instructions for this Session
- Goals today: …
- What to prioritize: …
- What to ignore: …
- Output format: … (e.g., plan, code, table)
  Tips
  Keep each subject’s recap to 200–400 words.
  Version and date-stamp summaries (e.g., v1.2 — added API change on 2025-10-12).
  Prefer links for long artifacts; include stable IDs (ticket numbers, branches, dataset versions).
  If your tool supports memory/pinned profiles, pin the Context Pack to avoid pasting each time.
  Common pitfalls
  Expecting the new chat to “know” old chats automatically. It won’t.
  Overlong recaps. Short, structured summaries perform better.
  Missing decisions/IDs. Include canonical names/paths to avoid ambiguity.
  If you share quick bullets for your prior subjects now, I can draft the carryover summaries you’ll paste into future chats.
