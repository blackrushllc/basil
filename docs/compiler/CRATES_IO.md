Totally—Junie means **crates.io** (the Rust package registry), not “cargo.io.”
Right now your one-step `bcc` flow only works when you pass local paths (like `--dep-source local --local-runtime …`). To make it work **anywhere** (no repo on disk), the tiny Rust project that `bcc` generates must pull your runtime crates from **crates.io**. That means you need to **publish** your runtime crates there.

Here’s the quick map + copy-paste checklist.

# What you need to publish (so `bcc` works without the repo)

Publish these as libraries on crates.io:

* `libbasilrt` — the Basil runtime API used by compiled programs
* `basil-obj-audio`, `basil-obj-midi`, `basil-obj-daw`, `basil-obj-term` — feature crates that `libbasilrt` exposes/uses

(Your internal compiler bits like `basil-frontend`, `basil-ir`, `backend-rs`, and the VM aren’t needed by end users for AOT and can stay unpublished.)

# One-time setup

1. Create/log in to **crates.io** using your GitHub account.
2. In crates.io → Account → **New Token**, create an API token.
3. On your dev machine:

   ```bat
   cargo login <YOUR_TOKEN>
   ```

   (Stores the token for publishing.)

# Per-crate prep (do this inside each crate’s folder)

1. In `Cargo.toml`, fill the required metadata:

   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "libbasilrt"         # or basil-obj-term, etc.
   version = "0.1.0"
   edition = "2021"
   license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"         # pick what you want
   description = "Basil runtime for AOT-compiled programs"
   repository = "https://github.com/blackrushllc/basil"
   readme = "README.md"
   keywords = ["basil","basic","runtime","audio","midi","terminal"]
   categories = ["command-line-utilities","development-tools"]
   ```

    * If you use a `LICENSE` file: `license-file = "LICENSE"` instead of `license`.
    * Add `include = [ "src/**", "Cargo.toml", "README.md", "LICENSE", "build.rs" ]` to keep the package small.
2. Convert **workspace path deps** into **versioned deps** for publish:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   # before (dev): libbasilrt = { path = "../libbasilrt" }
   # after (publish): libbasilrt = { version = "0.1.0" }
   ```

   Use `[patch.crates-io]` only for local dev—**do not** publish with it.
3. Make sure features are clean and monomorphic (avoid heavy generics bloat).
4. Dry run:

   ```bash
   cargo publish --dry-run
   cargo package --list   # inspect what will be uploaded
   ```

# Publish order (important)

1. **libbasilrt**

   ```bash
   cargo publish -p libbasilrt
   ```
2. Each **basil-obj-*** crate that depends on it (wait ~60s after each if the index lags):

   ```bash
   cargo publish -p basil-obj-audio
   cargo publish -p basil-obj-midi
   cargo publish -p basil-obj-daw
   cargo publish -p basil-obj-term
   ```

# Update `bcc` to use the registry versions

Have `bcc` generate a `Cargo.toml` like:

```toml
[dependencies]
libbasilrt = { version = "=0.1.0", features = [ "audio","midi","daw","term" ] }
basil-obj-audio = "=0.1.0"   # include only if selected
basil-obj-midi  = "=0.1.0"
basil-obj-daw   = "=0.1.0"
basil-obj-term  = "=0.1.0"

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
lto = "thin"
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
```

* The `=` **pins** exact versions for reproducible AOT builds.
* `bcc` still supports your **local path mode** (`--dep-source local --local-runtime …`) for offline or bleeding-edge testing.

# Release hygiene (helps avoid surprises)

* **Version bump** everything together (use `cargo set-version` from `cargo-edit` if you like).
* Tag the repo, write a short `CHANGELOG`.
* If you accidentally publish a bad build, you can **yank** the version on crates.io (it remains available but won’t be picked by new resolution).

# Alternatives if you don’t want public crates (optional)

* **Private registry**: host your own index (advanced).
* **Vendoring**: `cargo vendor` your deps and teach `bcc` to output a `.cargo/config.toml` pointing at vendored sources.
* **Prebuilt runtime**: much more work; generally not worth it compared to crates.io.

---

## TL;DR

* It’s **crates.io**, the registry Cargo pulls from.
* Publish `libbasilrt` + `basil-obj-*` there (with proper metadata).
* `bcc` will then generate projects that depend on those exact versions—no git repo needed on the user’s machine.
* Keep your local path mode for dev; ship registry mode for users.

If you want, I can draft the exact `Cargo.toml` metadata blocks for each crate and a tiny `.github/workflows/publish.yml` that runs `cargo publish --dry-run` on tags to preflight everything before you hit the button.
