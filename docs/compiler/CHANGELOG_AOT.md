# AOT (bcc) recent changes

- Move final executable into the invoking directory (CWD) and name it after the source file (hello.basil â†’ hello.exe on Windows, hello on Unix). Overwrites if present and prints the local path.
- Generated Cargo projects now include an empty [workspace] table to isolate them from ancestor workspaces (prevents `current package believes it's in a workspace` errors when building from within the Basil repo).
- Local runtime path handling improved: `--dep-source local --local-runtime <path>` now canonicalizes and sanitizes Windows paths (strips `\\?\` prefixes, uses forward slashes).
