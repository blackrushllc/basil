# PART 1: BASIL NATIVE MVC

A Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

# Thoughts

* Create a new Basil Feature Object (Mod) called `MVC`
* Create a new Basil Feature Object method for View
* Create a new Basil Feature Object method for Controller
* Create a new Basil Feature Object method for Model
* Create a new Basil Feature Object method for Router
* Create a new Basil Feature Object method for Template Engine (Fred)
* Create a new Basil Feature Object method for Template Engine (Blade)
* Create a new Basil Feature Object method for Template Engine (Twig)
* Create a new Basil Feature Object method for Template Engine (Smarty)

Use "Yore" as a prototype.

* Domain/Page routes (section / pagekey)
* Modeltroller routes (web_, api_, etc.)
* Custom Module routes (web_, api_, etc.)
* JSON page, env and and module configs

Built-in server, or server with custom routes.

Bytecode compiling on page load

Or a stand-alone server.

Support for doing the worker thread things for Apache or Nginx or IIS or Lighttpd or Caddy or etc (I forgot what that's called)

Be able to compile the server into the program what uses the MVC (and SQL and all that stuff)

So the compiled server can be used as a standalone server or as stand-alone server with the MVC program.

ooooor maybe the compiled server can be used as a standalone server with the MVC program and the MVC program can be used as a standalone server.
