## Short answer
Both work. I can complete the whole task in one shot or proceed in clearly defined sections. For small, well-specified tasks, “all at once” is usually faster. For larger or ambiguous tasks, breaking it into phases (day 1, day 2, etc.) typically produces better accuracy and lets you steer the work.

### Why you sometimes saw sections
If I previously proposed a phased/day-by-day plan, it was to make testing, review, and course-correction easier—not because I can’t do it all at once. Iteration reduces the risk of rework when requirements aren’t fully locked in or when features may or may not be supported yet.

### When to ask for sections
- The scope is large (multiple files, docs, code changes, tests, CI updates).
- Requirements may change, or you want checkpoints for review/approval.
- There are unknowns or external constraints (e.g., feature support might be missing or evolving).
- You want to see intermediate deliverables (design, plan, prototypes) before full implementation.
- You’ll have stakeholders who need to sign off on each phase.

### When to ask for “all at once”
- The task is small, concrete, and fully specified.
- You have clear acceptance criteria and examples.
- You prefer speed over intermediate review cycles.
- You’re comfortable reviewing a single, comprehensive PR or patch.

### Recommended workflow (hybrid, usually best)
1. Alignment first: Ask me to produce a concise plan or outline with milestones, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.
2. Approve or adjust the plan.
3. Implement in phases with explicit “stop-and-wait” points. I’ll deliver diffs, code snippets, and test notes at the end of each phase.
4. Final integration pass to polish, deduplicate, and update docs.

This gives you the speed of parallelizable work and the control of checkpoints.

### How to phrase your request (copy/paste templates)
- All at once (small tasks):
  ```
  Do this in one pass: <task>. Deliverables: <list>. Constraints: <list>. Acceptance criteria: <list>. Output as a single patch/diff plus any run instructions.
  ```
- Phased (larger/unknowns):
  ```
  Propose a 3-phase plan for <task>. Include goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria per phase. Stop after the plan for my approval. After approval, do Phase 1 only and pause for review before moving to Phase 2.
  ```
- Timeboxed iteration (exploration):
  ```
  Spend one iteration to explore options for <problem>. Return findings, trade-offs, a recommended approach, and a concrete plan. Stop and wait for approval before implementation.
  ```

### What I need from you for either mode
- Clear definition of done (what counts as success).
- Constraints (tooling, language versions, style, performance targets).
- Environment details (OS, IDE, commands you want supported).
- Any must-not-change files or interfaces.

### TL;DR
- I’m equally capable of doing everything at once or in sections.
- Choose sections when you want tighter feedback loops and reduced risk; choose all-at-once when the task is small and well-specified.
- A short planning step followed by phased execution tends to give the best outcomes for anything non-trivial.
