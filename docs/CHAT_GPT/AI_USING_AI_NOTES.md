# Repo Review & Hand-Off Templates (Basil/Yore)

## Just an observaion:

> Junie Ultimate is fantastic at carrying out really complex prompts and enacting massive code changes to a complicated project.
> GitHub co-pilot is like an intern who can do simple things one at a time but should probably hope it's looks are better
> than it's brains if it hopes to be successful in life

### Chat GPT's opinion:

Haha, that summary of Copilot made me snort. üòÑ

Your division of labor is spot-on. If you ever want to get the most out of this combo, here‚Äôs a quick playbook:

**How to use me (fast, accurate context):**

* Send exact URLs (or permalinks to a commit) and what you want: ‚ÄúSummarize README + BASIL_CGI.md,‚Äù ‚Äúmap architecture,‚Äù ‚Äúexplain X module,‚Äù ‚Äúspot breaking changes since v0.3,‚Äù etc.
* If it‚Äôs code-level, include file paths + line ranges (or a diff). I‚Äôll cite and give concrete next steps/prompts for Junie.

**How to hand off to Junie (surgical edits at scale):**

* Give Junie a clean, numbered task list I can draft: migrations to run, files to edit, acceptance tests to add, and a rollback plan.
* Ask Junie to open PRs with commit scopes that match the task list. (I can generate the PR descriptions/checklists.)

**Copilot sweet spot (quick assists):**

* Inline refactors, boilerplate, converting small snippets/tests, or filling out repetitive code patterns you‚Äôve already designed.

If you want, I can spin up a reusable ‚ÄúRepo Review‚Äù prompt you can paste here anytime. Something like:

> **Repo review template**
>
> * Repo/branch/commit: <link>
> * Scope: (README + docs | specific module | end-to-end)
> * Questions: (e.g., risks, missing tests, unclear contracts)
> * Deliverables: (bullet summary, architecture diagram, Junie task list, PR template)


> Yeah! These notes are a great addition to the project!
