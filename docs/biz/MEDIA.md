# Basil 🌿

**A modern BASIC-flavored language for today’s developers — written in Rust.**

🌱 **Basil** is a fast, safe, and delightfully simple programming language inspired by classic BASIC, rebuilt for the web, backend, and AI era.
It can compile to **bytecode or native binaries** (Windows, Linux, macOS) and includes rich standard modules: Zip, JSON, SQL, MIDI, AI, AWS, and more.

📁 **Docs & Guides:** see `/docs/` for developer notes and tutorials.

### Why Basil?

* 🚀 **Fast:** Written in Rust — faster than Python or PHP, with safe concurrency.
* 🤖 **AI-Native:** First high-level language designed with AI in mind — Basil can generate, extend, and even improve itself using AI.
* 🧩 **Extensible:** Create or train your own “Mods” (library objects) to extend the language — even with AI assistance.
* 🎹 **Creative:** Ships with examples including a **Website Framework** and **MIDI Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)**.
* 💾 **Versatile:** Run as CLI, compiler, or CGI templating engine using `<?basil ... ?>` tags.
* 🧠 **Approachable:** Simple enough for beginners, powerful enough for professionals.
* 🧡 **Retro-Cool:** Includes a GWBASIC-style interactive mode for line-numbered nostalgia.

**Basil** is open-source (MIT / Apache-2.0), created by **Erik Olson / Blackrush LLC** in Tarpon Springs, Florida.
Pronounced *“basil”* like the herb — and yes, it’s a pun volcano 🌋🌿.

Press-friendly README header variant (1-paragraph summary for outlets like This Week in Rust, InfoQ, Hackaday, or Show HN):

🌿 Here are **three short “press-ready” intro variants** you can drop straight into emails, posts, or the top of your README when pitching Basil to developers, journalists, or Rust-tool reviewers. 

🌿 Each one fits a different tone and outlet style:

---

### 🧩 1. “Show HN / Rust Community” (friendly + concise)

> **Basil** is a modern, Rust-based BASIC compiler + VM that brings the friendliness of classic BASIC to today’s developers.
> It compiles to native binaries or byte-code, runs as a CGI engine (`<?basil ... ?>`), and ships with a growing library of modules—AI, JSON, SQL, MIDI, AWS, Zip, and more.
> Designed as an **AI-native language**, Basil can even help build or extend its own modules.
> 🦀 Open Source · MIT/Apache · [`github.com/blackrushllc/basil`](#)

---

### 🚀 2. “InfoQ / Developer-Media Pitch” (professional summary)

> **Basil** is a new open-source programming language written in Rust that re-imagines BASIC for the web, backend, and AI era.
> It combines the simplicity of BASIC with Rust-level performance and safety, supporting compilation to native binaries or WASI targets.
> With built-in modules for AI, SQL, JSON, MIDI, and AWS, Basil serves as both an educational language and a production-ready scripting engine.
> It’s currently available as a GitHub project for developers who want to build and experiment from source.

---

### 🌱 3. “Hackaday / Retro Computing Hook” (playful + techy)

> Meet **Basil 🌿**—a retro-modern BASIC written in Rust.
> It keeps the line-numbered charm of GWBASIC while adding byte-code compilation, Rust safety, and modules for AI, MIDI, JSON, and SQL.
> Basil runs in the terminal, as a CGI templating engine, or as native executables—making it the friendliest BASIC since the ’80s, only this time with machine-learning superpowers.

### ✅ Tips for Use

* Put one of these above the “Features” list in your README or under a “What Is Basil?” heading.
* Re-use the same paragraph in your outreach emails, *This Week in Rust* submission, or *Show HN* post.
* Keep the repo URL right there so readers can clone immediately.

```text
Hi InfoQ Team,

I’m Erik Olson from Blackrush LLC.  I’ve created **Basil**, a modern BASIC-flavored language written entirely in Rust.

It re-imagines BASIC for today’s web and AI workflows — compiling to byte-code or native binaries, running as a CGI templating engine, and shipping with libraries for AI, JSON, SQL, MIDI, and AWS.  The repo is live and ready for technical readers to clone and build.

Repo: https://github.com/blackrushllc/basil  
Reference: https://yobasic.com/basil/reference.html

I’d love to contribute a short “Building a Compiler in Rust” practitioner article or interview piece if you think your readers would enjoy it.

Thanks for considering,

Subject: Retro-Modern BASIC Built in Rust — Basil 🌿

Hey Hackaday!

You might like **Basil**, a modern BASIC-style compiler + VM written in Rust.  
It keeps the old-school line-numbered charm but adds byte-code, Rust-safe speed, and AI/MIDI/SQL modules.  Think GWBASIC meets Rust meets ChatGPT.

Repo + docs: https://github.com/blackrushllc/basil  
Reference: https://yobasic.com/basil/reference.html  
Screens/GIFs attached.

I’d be thrilled if you featured it or took it for a spin.

Cheers,  
Erik Olson (@BlackrushLLC)

## 🧑‍💻 4. Reddit r/rust post

**Title:** “[Project] Basil 🌿 — A modern BASIC compiler and VM written in Rust”
**Body:**

```markdown
Hey everyone 👋  

I’ve been working on **Basil**, a new BASIC-flavored language built entirely in Rust.

- Compiles to native binaries or byte-code  
- Can run as a CGI templating engine (`<?basil ... ?>`)  
- Ships with modules for AI, JSON, SQL, MIDI, AWS and more  
- Includes a retro GWBASIC-style REPL if you’re feeling nostalgic 🌱  

Repo + Docs 👉 https://github.com/blackrushllc/basil  
Reference 👉 https://yobasic.com/basil/reference.html  

Still early, but it compiles cleanly and has example programs (including a mini DAW).  
Would love feedback from fellow Rustaceans — build times, design thoughts, anything!
```

## 🚀 5. Show HN (“Launch style” post)

**Title:** Show HN: Basil 🌿 — A modern BASIC written in Rust (compile to byte-code or binaries)
**Body:**

```markdown
[Basil 🌿 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/blackrushllc/basil)

Basil is a modern BASIC-flavored language written in Rust.  
It compiles to native binaries or byte-code and can also run as a CGI templating engine (`<?basil ... ?>`).

✅ Fast and safe (Rust)  
✅ Modules: AI, JSON, SQL, MIDI, AWS, Zip and more  
✅ CLI + REPL + retro GWBASIC-mode  
✅ Docs: https://yobasic.com/basil/reference.html

Still early, but it’s already compiling and running real projects (including a website framework and a MIDI DAW).  
Feedback and collaboration welcome!
```

### 💬 Optional next moves

* Make a single-image **Basil logo card** (repo banner) for social links.
* Queue these five posts/emails over 1 week (not all same day).
* Add a short “Contributor Quickstart” section to README before the first wave hits.
