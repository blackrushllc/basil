## üåø Overview

**Basil** is a new open-source programming language that re-imagines classic BASIC for the web, backend, and AI era.  
It combines the simplicity of BASIC with the performance and safety of Rust.  
Basil can compile to **native binaries** (Windows, Linux, macOS) or **bytecode** for fast interpreted runs, and it can also act as a **CGI templating engine** using `<?basil ... ?>` tags ‚Äî just like PHP, but faster.

Basil is **AI-aware** from the ground up: it includes native modules for JSON, SQL, MIDI, AWS, ZIP, Base64, and even AI integration via the `obj-ai` library.  
Its companion tools (`bcc` compiler and `bvm` virtual machine) let developers build, run, and deploy Basil apps across all platforms.
