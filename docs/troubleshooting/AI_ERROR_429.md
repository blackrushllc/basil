Here’s how you can resolve the “HTTP 429: You exceeded your current quota” error and get set up with a paid plan so your API key works

---

## Why you’re seeing that error

* If you are on the free tier / trial, you’ve likely exhausted your allotted free API credits (or the trial period expired). ([Stack Overflow][1])
* Even after paying, your quota or usage limits may not automatically increase unless you request it. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])
* In some cases you need to generate a **new API key** after upgrading / adding billing before the new limits take effect. ([Stack Overflow][3])

## Steps to upgrade to a paid plan (and fix the quota issue)

Here’s a checklist:

1. **Log into the OpenAI Dashboard**

    * Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) (or your organization’s OpenAI admin console).

2. **Go to Billing / Payment settings**

    * In your account settings, look for a **Billing** or **Payments** section.
    * Add a valid credit or debit card / payment method. ([Brian H. Hough][4])
    * Add prepaid credits or switch to a “Pay-as-you-go” plan. ([Brian H. Hough][4])

3. **Upgrade or confirm your subscription / usage tier**

    * Some users describe that just adding the payment method / credit doesn’t immediately lift limits — the system must “promote” your account to a paid quota tier. ([Reddit][5])
    * On the “Usage Limits” or “Usage & Quotas” page, see whether you can request a higher quota. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])

4. **Generate a new API key (if needed)**

    * If your old API key was created under the free/trial plan, it may still be bound by the old limits. Many users report that generating a new key **after** the upgrade “unlocks” the higher quota. ([Stack Overflow][3])
    * Replace the old key in your BASIC interpreter (Basil) with the new one.

5. **Wait a little (propagation delay)**

    * After upgrading, there can be a short delay (minutes to maybe an hour) before the quota change fully takes effect. ([Stack Overflow][1])
    * During that time you might still see the 429 error until the system fully recognizes your upgraded status. ([Reddit][5])

6. **Monitor your usage and quota**

    * Keep an eye on your usage dashboard in OpenAI to see how many tokens / requests you’ve used and how much quota remains. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])
    * If you approach your quota, you may need to request a further increase. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])

7. **Contact OpenAI support if problems persist**

    * If you’ve done all the above and still see “quota exceeded,” open a support ticket with OpenAI, include your account info, screenshots, and the steps you’ve already tried.
