When the linker is choking on **PDB (debug info) generation** in *debug* profile on Windows but `--release` works because it either emits much less/no PDB data and uses a different link path, so you skip the failure.

Here’s a tight, pragmatic sequence that usually fixes **LNK1318: Unexpected PDB error; LIMIT (12)**:

# 1) Quick retries that often clear it

* **Close any stale PDB server** and clean:

  ```powershell
  taskkill /IM mspdbsrv.exe /F
  cargo clean -p basilc
  cargo build -p basilc
  ```

  (MS’s `mspdbsrv.exe` serializes PDB writes; stale instances can corrupt/lock PDBs. ([GitHub][1]))

* **Check free disk space** on the drive that holds `target\debug` and your TEMP folder. PDB writes are space-hungry and failing space checks can trigger LNK1318. ([GitHub][2])

* **Exclude `target\` from AV/OneDrive indexing** (Defender/Dropbox/OneDrive file locks can race the linker). Microsoft calls LNK1318 a generic PDB I/O failure (open/read/write). ([Microsoft Learn][3])

# 2) Make your *debug* profile easier on the linker

Pick one of these (you can undo later):

* **Lower debug info volume** (keeps symbols, but lighter):

  ```toml
  # .cargo/config.toml  (create if missing)
  [profile.dev]
  debug = 1   # default is 2; 1 is smaller PDBs
  ```

  Then `cargo build -p basilc`.

* **Temporarily disable PDB generation entirely** (fastest unblocks):

  ```powershell
  set RUSTFLAGS=-C link-arg=/DEBUG:NONE
  cargo build -p basilc
  ```

  (Removes debug symbols in this build only; turn it off when you need symbols again.)

* **Force older C7-style debug format (/Z7)** if you still hit it. MSVC sometimes avoids PDB writer issues with C7:

    * In native MSVC you’d switch to `/Z7`; with Rust you can approximate by **embedding more info in .obj** and reducing linker PDB work via `debug=1` (above). The underlying idea—“less work for the PDB linker”—is the same. ([Stack Overflow][4])

# 3) Toolchain sanity

* **Make sure you’re using the 64-bit toolset** (you are on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, which should call the 64-bit `link.exe`, but double-check your VS Build Tools selection is **x64**). Some folks avoid LNK1318 by using the x64 toolset even when cross-compiling. ([SourceForge][5])
* **Update Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools** to the latest (there have been **recent PDB bugs**; 17.14 had a LIMIT(12) report). ([Developer Community][6])

# 4) Project knobs to try if it persists

* **Turn off incremental compilation** in dev (reduces churn in PDBs):

  ```toml
  [profile.dev]
  incremental = false
  ```
* **Reduce parallel pressure** if you have multiple crates linking at once:

  ```powershell
  set CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1
  cargo build -p basilc
  ```
* **Recreate the debug dir** (nuke stale PDBs only):

  ```powershell
  Remove-Item target\debug\*.pdb -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
  ```

# Why this happens

LNK1318 means the linker hit an **unexpected PDB I/O/format failure**—commonly from file locks, corruption, too-big/fragmented PDBs, low disk space, or toolset bugs. The official docs are intentionally generic; the fixes above map to the typical causes. ([Microsoft Learn][3])

---

If you want a “set and forget” workaround while you test new features locally, I’d start with **`[profile.dev] debug = 1`** and **Defender exclusion on `target\`**, then **update VS Build Tools**. If it still bites, use **`/DEBUG:NONE`** for quick iterations and flip it off when you need symbols.

Want me to drop a tiny `.cargo/config.toml` that toggles these settings with comments so you can keep them in the repo?
