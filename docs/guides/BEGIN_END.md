### What `BEGIN` means in this BASIC interpreter

`BEGIN` is not normally part of the BASIC language.

In this project (BASIL), `BEGIN` introduces a block — a sequence of statements treated as a single statement — and `END` closes that block.

From the grammar and parser:
- `block := "BEGIN" { ...statements... } "END"`
- You can use a block wherever the grammar accepts a single `statement`.

### Where it’s used and when it’s required
Looking at the parser logic:
- IF…THEN
    - Single-statement form: `IF cond THEN <one statement> [ELSE <one statement>]` — no `BEGIN` required.
    - Block form: `IF cond THEN BEGIN ... [ELSE ...] END`
        - If you use `BEGIN` after `THEN`, the parser expects the `THEN`-block as a statement list terminated by `END`.
        - If there’s an `ELSE`, the `ELSE`-block can also be either a single statement or `BEGIN ... END`.
- FOR / FOR EACH
    - Body can be a single statement (no `BEGIN`) or a block using `BEGIN ... END`.
    - After the body, `NEXT [ident]` is required by the parser.
- Standalone blocks
    - You can write a bare `BEGIN ... END` to create a scoped block (`Stmt::Block`).
- FUNC definitions
    - Here, `BEGIN` is mandatory. After a `FUNC` header, the parser explicitly requires `BEGIN` and then reads until the matching `END`.

Concrete examples from the repo:
- `examples/hello.basil` lines 7–11:
  ```
  IF ans$ == "Y" THEN BEGIN
    PRINT "\nWinken";
    PRINT "\nBlinken";
    PRINT "\nNod;
  END
  ```
- `README.md` grammar also documents `block := "BEGIN" { declaration } "END"`.

### Why have `BEGIN`/`END` at all? Benefits
- Unambiguous parsing: The parser instantly knows when a multi-statement block starts and ends without needing indentation rules or numerous matching `END*` keywords.
- Uniform close token: A single `END` closes whatever was opened with `BEGIN`, keeping the keyword set small and nesting simple.
- Flexible statement bodies: Control structures (IF, FOR) can accept either a single statement (compact) or `BEGIN ... END` (multi-statement) with a clear delimiter.
- Simpler implementation: The current lexer/parser are straightforward because they rely on explicit delimiters rather than layout or complex lookahead rules.

### Could we eliminate `BEGIN` from the language?
Technically yes, but you must replace its role with some other delimiting rule. Options and trade-offs:

1) Use construct-specific terminators (classic BASIC style)
- Example: `IF ... THEN ... [ELSE ...] END IF`, `FOR ... NEXT`, `FUNC ... END FUNC`.
- Parser change: After `IF ... THEN`, parse a sequence of statements until `END IF` or `ELSE`; similarly for `FUNC` until `END FUNC`; for loops until `NEXT`.
- Pros: No `BEGIN`; blocks are still explicit. Familiar to many BASIC users.
- Cons: Increases the keyword/phrase set (`END IF`, `END FOR`, `END FUNC`, etc.). The current parser uses a single `END` with `BEGIN` as the opener; you’d need to add and recognize the paired end-phrases.

2) Adopt braces `{ ... }` (C-style)
- Replace `BEGIN`/`END` with `{`/`}`.
- Pros: Concise and familiar to C-like language users.
- Cons: Changes the language’s BASIC flavor; requires lexer support for `{` and `}` and parser changes.

3) Indentation-based blocks (Python-style)
- Use newlines/indentation to form blocks; no explicit `BEGIN`/`END`.
- Pros: Minimal syntax noise.
- Cons: Considerably more complex scanner/parser; whitespace becomes semantically significant; contrary to traditional BASIC.

4) “Implicit until sentinel” without an opener
- After `IF ... THEN`, treat everything up to `ELSE` or an `END`-variant as the block, even without `BEGIN`.
- Pros: Eliminates `BEGIN` in block-y spots.
- Cons: You still need a clear, unambiguous sentinel (e.g., `END IF`). Without specific `END IF`, nested constructs become ambiguous. Using a bare `END` without a prior opener would be very error-prone.

### What would have to change to remove `BEGIN` now?
- Lexer: Remove the `Begin` token and likely add `END IF`, `END FOR`, `END FUNC` (or similar) tokens/phrases, or add `{`/`}`.
- Parser:
    - IF: After `THEN`, parse either one statement or a statement list until `ELSE`/`END IF`. If `ELSE` appears, parse either a single statement or a list until `END IF`.
    - FOR/FOR EACH: Parse body until `NEXT` (as it already does), but you need a way to permit multiple statements; now `BEGIN` provides that. Either make everything up to `NEXT` a block, or introduce `END FOR`.
    - FUNC: Replace the mandatory `BEGIN` with a terminator like `END FUNC`, or infer end-of-function via another header — the explicit terminator is cleaner.
    - Standalone blocks: If you still want arbitrarily scoped blocks, you need an alternative (`{ ... }` or drop the feature).

### Practical recommendation
- Keep `BEGIN`/`END` for v0: It matches the current implementation and examples, keeps the grammar simple, and allows both single-statement and multi-statement forms cleanly.
- If you want to remove it later, the least disruptive BASIC-like path is to:
    - Introduce `END IF`, `END FOR`, `END FUNC` (and optionally `ENDIF` as a single token),
    - Make `IF ... THEN` parse a list of statements until its dedicated end token,
    - Keep `NEXT` as the loop terminator or switch to `END FOR`,
    - Replace function `BEGIN` with `END FUNC`.
    - Update docs and examples accordingly.

### Short answers to your question
- What is `BEGIN` used for? To start a multi-statement block that ends with `END`.
- When is it required? Always for function bodies; for control structures when you want more than one statement in the body; and for standalone scoped blocks.
- What benefit does it have? Clear, unambiguous block delimiting with a small keyword set; simpler parsing and clean nesting; BASIC-like feel while allowing both single-line and multi-line bodies.
- Can we eliminate it? Yes, but only by adopting another clear block delimiting strategy (construct-specific end tokens, braces, or indentation). Doing so requires coordinated lexer/parser and grammar changes and will affect most examples/documentation.
