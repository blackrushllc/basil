heck yes—this is the fun part. here’s a crisp, realistic blueprint for a Basil-made **mini-DAW** that feels like late-80s Cakewalk meets a modern “Raptor”-style minimalism. it assumes we have `obj-daw`, `obj-audio`, `obj-midi`, `obj-term` available.

# vision

A fast-to-open, keyboard-driven terminal DAW you can actually *use*: pick devices, arm a track, hit record, play a part on your MIDI keyboard, hear a built-in synth, capture MIDI, overdub audio, and save/load projects. It’s linear (arrangement) with a simple clip model, basic mixer, and a piano-roll editor. Think **“1 evening to learn, weeks to enjoy.”**

# core pillars (MVP)

1. **Projects & files**

    * `.basilproj.json` format (human-readable): tempo, time sig, tracks, clips, device prefs.
    * Audio assets (WAV) and MIDI clips stored alongside in a `project_name/` folder.
2. **Tracks**

    * **MIDI tracks** (route to built-in synth or an external MIDI out later).
    * **Audio tracks** (arm & record from an input, or import WAV).
3. **Transport**

    * Play/Stop, Record, Loop on/off, Metronome (click).
    * Tempo BPM (e.g., 60–240), time signature (e.g., 4/4).
4. **Editing**

    * MIDI: quantize (1/4..1/32), transpose, humanize (±ticks), velocity scale.
    * Audio: trim clip start/end, slip-edit, clip gain.
5. **Mixer (very simple)**

    * Per-track: Mute, Solo, Volume (linear), Pan.
6. **Synth (built-in)**

    * Poly sine/saw/square; ADSR envelope; simple low-pass; voice limit (8–32).
7. **Render/Export**

    * Bounce to WAV (offline render using the same engine graph).
8. **Terminal UI**

    * Crossterm screens: Arrangement, Mixer, Piano Roll, Devices, Help.
    * Keyboard-first navigation + clear status bar.

# screen tour (obj-term power)

* **Top bar**: Project name • Time position (bar:beat:tick) • BPM • TS • CPU % • Messages.
* **Arrangement** (default): Tracks as rows, timeline columns (condensed). Clips shown as blocks (“[####]”). Cursor selects clips/track.
* **Mixer**: Channel strips (Vol/Pan/M/S meters).
* **Piano Roll** (MIDI clips): grid editor; left shows keys; right shows notes; velocity lane on bottom.
* **Devices**: pick input/output/MIDI ports by substring; save as defaults.
* **Help**: cheat-sheet of hotkeys.

Coloring via `COLOR(fg,bg)`; cursor via `LOCATE`; status updates with `CURSOR_SAVE/RESTORE` for snappy redraws.

# hotkeys (suggested)

* **Space** Play/Stop • **R** Record • **L** Loop on/off • **M** Metronome
* **F1** Help • **F2** Arrangement • **F3** Mixer • **F4** Piano Roll • **F5** Devices
* **↑/↓** Track select • **←/→** Move playhead • **A** Arm audio • **I** Arm MIDI
* **Q** Quantize • **T** Transpose • **H** Humanize • **V** Velocity scale
* **S** Solo • **U** Mute • **,/.** Nudge clip • **Enter** Edit/Confirm
* **Ctrl+S** Save • **Ctrl+O** Open • **Ctrl+B** Bounce mixdown

# timing model

* **Project rate** equals output device rate (MVP; resampling later).
* **Timeline unit**: Bars/Beats/Ticks with **PPQ=960** (nice MIDI resolution).
* Scheduler runs every audio buffer:

    * convert current time (samples) → (bar,beat,tick).
    * dispatch MIDI events scheduled within this block to synth.
    * mix audio tracks (WAV readers) + synth bus → master.
* **Metronome**: click sample or synthesized blip on beat; optional count-in.

# data shapes (simple & friendly)

{

    }
  ],

}
```

# engine architecture (in Basil terms)

* **UI thread** (Basil main):

    * Draw screens (obj-term), handle hotkeys, edit project JSON in memory.
    * Control **Transport State** (playing/recording/loop, playhead sample).
* **Audio RT** (via obj-audio/obj-daw):

    * Output stream callback: pull scheduled MIDI for the block → synth.render → sum audio tracks → master.
    * Input stream (if any armed): push to ring; record loop on main thread writes to WAV.
* **MIDI input** (obj-midi):

    * Callback queues events into a non-blocking ring for the scheduler + live-thru.
* **Rings**:

    * `in_ring` for audio capture, `ui_events` for key/mouse, `midi_in_queue` for note/cc.

# workflows

## 1) first-run “device wizard”

* Screen: pick Audio Out (default), Audio In (optional), MIDI In (keyboard).
* Persist choices in project template + global prefs.

## 2) live-thru & record MIDI

* Arm MIDI track → **live-thru** to synth → hear instantly.
* Hit **R** → capture note/velocity/time (PPQ). Quantize if chosen.
* Stop → new MIDI clip created at the time region.

## 3) record audio

* Arm Audio track → monitor (optional) → **R** to start WAV writer (16/24-bit).
* Stop → clip referencing captured WAV; show waveform stub (ASCII envelope).

## 4) edit MIDI

* F4 to Piano Roll → arrow keys move cursor, **Ins/Del** add/remove notes, **Q/T/H/V** transforms.

## 5) mix & bounce

* F3 Mixer → adjust Vol/Pan, Mute/Solo.
* Ctrl+B → offline render: iterate timeline blocks, sum synth + audio, write `mixdown.wav`.

# minimal command surface (under the hood)

You already have most via our feature objects; the DAW glue script uses:

* **Transport**: play/stop/locate/loop flags; metronome schedule; record gates.
* **Audio**: open output, start stream, connect ring to out; WAV write for armed audio.
* **MIDI**: poll input queue; push events to track-scheduler; optional MIDI-thru.
* **Synth**: one instance per MIDI track (voice-managed); simple filter & ADSR.
* **UI**: `CLS/LOCATE/COLOR/…` for screens; redraw diff on resize.

# tiny pseudocode slices (Basil-style)

## engine tick (called each UI loop; RT audio does the heavy lifting)

```basic
REM update timing;
nowSamples% = AUDIO_NOW_SAMPLES%();  REM provided by obj-daw (or we track)
pos@ = SAMPLES_TO_BBT@(nowSamples%);  REM {bar%, beat%, tick%}

REM drain MIDI input;
WHILE MIDI_POLL%(midiIn@) > 0 BEGIN
  ev$[] = MIDI_GET_EVENT$[](midiIn@);
  QUEUE_MIDI_TO_TRACKS%(project@, ev$[], nowSamples%);
END

REM schedule events for current block for each MIDI track;
FOR EACH tr@ IN project@.Tracks BEGIN
  IF tr@.Type$ == "midi" THEN
    DISPATCH_MIDI_FOR_BLOCK%(tr@, nowSamples%);
  ENDIF
END
```

## drawing a header (obj-term)

```basic
CURSOR_HIDE; COLOR("brightwhite","blue"); CLS;
LOCATE(2,1); PRINT "Project: "; PRINT projName$;
LOCATE(30,1); PRINT "Pos: "; PRINT bar%; PRINT ":"; PRINT beat%; PRINT ":"; PRINT tick%;
LOCATE(50,1); PRINT "BPM: "; PRINT tempo%;
COLOR_RESET; CURSOR_SHOW;
```

# constraints & choices

* **Keep it linear** (no complex clip warping/tempo map in MVP).
* **No plugins initially** (add simple EQ/compressor later if we want).
* **One global tempo**; swing via MIDI quantize only.
* **Device rate** = project rate; resampling is phase 2.

# stretch goals (when we’re ready)

* Per-clip time-stretch (elastique-style later).
* MIDI out to external gear.
* Step sequencer view for drum parts.
* Session view (scenes) for live jamming.
* Project autosave & undo stack.
* Ratatui frontend variant (for richer widgets) while keeping Crossterm baseline.

---

## why this wins

* **Small surface, real outcomes**: you can track ideas tonight—play a synth, record MIDI, sing a take, and bounce a mix.
* **Teachable**: every concept maps 1-to-1 to the feature objects we built.
* **Extensible**: JSON projects + clear engine loop → easy to add power without rewriting.

If you want, I’ll turn this into a **repo scaffold**: `main.basil` (UI loop), `engine.basil` (scheduler), `synth_preset.json`, `examples/`. We can ship with two demo projects: “Piano Jam” (MIDI only) and “Voice Note” (audio + click).





> Yes please

Here’s your **Basil mini-DAW scaffold**—ready to explore, extend, and show off:

[Download the repo scaffold](sandbox:/mnt/data/basil-mini-daw.zip)

### What’s inside

* `src/main.basil` — entrypoint, Crossterm UI loop (arrangement/mixer/devices/help)
* `src/ui.basil` — header/footer and screen drawing helpers using `obj-term`
* `src/engine.basil` — transport stubs + a working **voice-memo demo** (`R` to record 3s → auto-play)
* `src/storage.basil` — project load stub
* `projects/PianoJam/project.json` & `projects/VoiceNote/project.json`
* `docs/roadmap.md` — step-by-step path from scaffold → full MVP

### Run it

```bash
cargo run -p basilc --features obj-daw,obj-term -- run src/main.basil
```

Hotkeys: **F1** Help • **F2** Arrangement • **F3** Mixer • **F4** Devices • **Space** Play/Stop (placeholder) • **R** record 3s memo • **Q** quit.

Want me to wire in a real transport/metronome next, or drop in a basic piano-roll editor screen?




> Yes, wire in a real transport/metronome



Transport engaged. Grab the updated scaffold here:

[Download mini-DAW with transport + metronome](sandbox:/mnt/data/basil-mini-daw-with-transport.zip)

### What changed

* **Real transport clock** tied to the audio device’s sample rate
* **Metronome** with accented beat 1, regular beats 2–4 (configurable beats/bar)
* **Live audio engine**: opens output, runs a ring-backed output stream, and **pumps** 20ms blocks
* **Controls**:
  Space = Play/Stop • **M** = Metronome on/off • **+ / -** = BPM up/down • **R** = 3s voice memo demo • **Q** = Quit
* **Header** now shows Play state and Metronome state

### Run it

```bash
# Requires obj-term + obj-audio + obj-daw features
cargo run -p basilc --features obj-daw,obj-term,obj-audio -- run src/main.basil
```

### Notes

* The engine schedules click sounds precisely at beat boundaries using sample math.
* It pushes silence between clicks to keep the ring fed—no underruns.
* Default devices use `"usb"` substrings; tweak in `src/engine.basil` or your project loader.

Want me to wire up a **count-in**, **loop region**, or display the **bar:beat:tick** position in the header next?




> Yes,  wire up a count-in, loop region, or display the bar:beat:tick position in the header next, and then remind me about the suggestion you had to drop in a basic piano-roll editor screen.



Loop + count-in + BBT are all wired in. Grab the updated scaffold:

[Download: mini-DAW with transport, loop, count-in, and BBT](sandbox:/mnt/data/basil-mini-daw-transport-loop-bbt.zip)

### What’s new

* **Bar:Beat:Tick** shown live in the header (PPQ=960).
* **Loop region** (default **[1..5)**) with toggle (**L**). Playhead wraps inside the loop.
* **Count-in (1 bar)** toggle (**C**). When enabled, starting playback gives a one-bar click before the timeline rolls.
* **Metronome** still on **M**, **+/-** adjusts BPM, **Space** toggles play/stop.

### Run

```bash
cargo run -p basilc --features obj-daw,obj-term,obj-audio -- run src/main.basil
```

### Keys (quick)

Space Play/Stop • M Metronome • L Loop • C Count-in • +/- BPM • R 3s memo demo • F1–F4 screens • Q Quit

---

And as a reminder on the next step you asked about:

### Next up: drop in a basic **piano-roll editor** screen

Plan:

* Add `PianoRoll` screen (F6, for example) that edits the selected MIDI clip.
* Grid: rows = MIDI notes (e.g., 36–96), columns = beats (zoomable). Draw with `obj-term` box glyphs.
* Editing:

    * Arrow keys move the cursor (note/time).
    * **Enter** toggles a note at the cursor (adds/removes).
    * **Shift+←/→** nudge selected note by ±1 tick or ±1 grid step.
    * **Z/X** zoom grid (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32).
    * **V** +/- adjusts velocity of selected note(s).
    * **Q** quantize selection to current grid.
* Data path:

    * Keep a simple in-memory array `notes[]` per clip: `{ tick_start, tick_len, pitch, velocity }`.
    * On save, serialize into the project’s MIDI clip JSON; on play, scheduler dispatches events per block.
* Nice to have: audition notes when moving/adding (MIDI-thru to synth).

Say the word and I’ll add the Piano Roll screen scaffold (drawing + basic insert/delete/nudge) to this repo.
