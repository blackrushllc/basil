  <h2>Minimal Basil CGI site</h2>
  <p>
    This demo shows a tiny CGI web skeleton rendered by Basil. Basil files
    emit the full HTML page (doctype, head, header, footer) and pull in these
    view snippets for the inner body. It also demonstrates a SQLite-backed
    user store and the simplest cookie-based session.
