# Basil ðŸŒ¿

ðŸŒ± A modern BASICâ€‘flavored language focused on web/backâ€‘end with the 
ability to compile to bytecode or binaries, across all platforms, and includes lots of library modules
such as Zip, Base64, JSON, SQL, MIDI, AI, and more.

ðŸŒ± Basil is the first high level interpreted and compiled language designed with AI in mind, from code generation, module building, and even adding features or fixing bugs in itself!

ðŸŒ± Basil programs can be compiled
to native binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Basil can also run as a CGI script templating engine
using \<?basil .. ?> tags like Php.  

ðŸŒ± Basil is easier to use, and much faster than Python or Php.

ðŸŒ± Basil includes lots of sample programs including a complete Website Framework and MIDI DAW application.

ðŸŒ± Basil puts the power of AI in the hands of the student, hobbyist, and professional programmer.

ðŸŒ± Basil includes the ability to have your favorite AI train itself on how to make Basil Library mods and write Basil code.

ðŸŒ± Basil is inspired by Bob Zale's PowerBASIC and the warmth and simplicity of BASIC, 
but reimagined for today's developer needs with modern features, a robust standard library, 
and seamless interoperability with C and WebAssembly (WASI).

ðŸŒ± Basil is written in Rust for safety and performance, and aims to provide a delightful developer experience.

ðŸŒ± Basil is open source under the MIT or Apache-2.0 license.

ðŸŒ± Basil is a project by Blackrush LLC (https://blackrush.us).

ðŸŒ± Basil is pronounced like "basil" the herb, and is a pun volcano.

### Quick Try:

ðŸŒ¿ Running a basil program without rebuilding the VM:

```terminal
target/release/basilc run examples/hello.basil
# or
target/debug/basilc run examples/hello.basil
```

Building and deploying Basil to run CGI scripts on Linux:

```
cargo build --release -p basilc
install -m 0755 target/release/basilc /usr/lib/cgi-bin/basil.cgi
```

ðŸŒ¿ Running a basil program with a bunch of libraries

```terminal
cargo run -q -p basilc --features "obj-curl obj-zip obj-base64" -- run examples/zip_demo.basil
```

ðŸŒ¿ Running a basil program with a full build (all libraries)

```terminal
cargo run -q -p basilc --features obj-all -- run examples/objects.basil
```

Terminal control (obj-term):

- Enable the terminal feature and run examples:
  cargo run -q -p basilc --features obj-term -- run examples/term/01_colors_and_cls.basil

- New commands when enabled:
  CLS, CLEAR, HOME, LOCATE(x%, y%), COLOR(fg, bg), COLOR_RESET, ATTR(bold%, underline%, reverse%), ATTR_RESET,
  CURSOR_SAVE, CURSOR_RESTORE, TERM_COLS%(), TERM_ROWS%(), CURSOR_HIDE, CURSOR_SHOW, TERM_ERR$()

Color values for COLOR can be 0..15 or names (case-insensitive):
  0=Black, 1=Red, 2=Green, 3=Yellow, 4=Blue, 5=Magenta, 6=Cyan, 7=White, 8=Grey,
  9=BrightRed, 10=BrightGreen, 11=BrightYellow, 12=BrightBlue, 13=BrightMagenta, 14=BrightCyan, 15=BrightWhite
  Names: "black","red","green","yellow","blue","magenta","cyan","white","grey",
         "brightred","brightgreen","brightyellow","brightblue","brightmagenta","brightcyan","brightwhite"

Examples are in examples/term/.

# ðŸŒ± Basil Prototype v0 â€” Public Plan & Skeleton

A minimal, publicâ€‘ready blueprint for a modern BASICâ€‘flavored language focused on web/backâ€‘end. This plan targets a tiny, endâ€‘toâ€‘end slice: **source â†’ tokens â†’ Abstract Syntax Tree â†’ bytecode â†’ VM** with room to evolve into C/WASM/JS backends.

---

## 0) Highâ€‘level goals

* ðŸŒ± **Developer joy**: BASIC warmth + modern features (expressions, async later, modules).
* ðŸŒ± **Simple core now, room to grow**: start with a stack VM, evolve to register/SSA.
* ðŸŒ± **Interop first**: design a stable C Application Binary Interface (ABI) and WASI component boundary (later phases).
* ðŸŒ± **Linux + Windows, single binary toolchain**.

---

## 1) ðŸŒ± Repository layout (Rust host)
