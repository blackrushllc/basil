ðŸŒ± Basil is a Modern, Mod-able, AI-aware, Object Oriented (or not) BASIC language Bytecode Interpreter and **Cross-Platform
Compiler** with lots of Rad Mods such as AI, AWS, Zip, Crypt (Base64, PGP) CrossTerm, Inet (SMTP, FTP, Json, Curl, REST, etc), 
SQL(MySQL/Postgres, RDS, Sqlite, ORM, etc), MIDI (Audio, DAW), and even a Totally Tubular "OK Prompt" CLI mode 
(Jolt Cola not included)

ðŸŒ± Basil is the first high level interpreted and compiled language designed with AI in mind, from code generation, module building, and even adding features or fixing bugs in itself!

ðŸŒ± Basil programs can be compiled to native binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Basil can also run as a CGI script templating engine
using \<?basil .. ?> tags like Php.  

ðŸŒ± Basil is easier learn and to use, and much faster than Python or Php.

ðŸŒ± Basil has all of the simplicity of old BASIC, but with all of the features of modern languages like Python or Go, plus the power of AI.

ðŸŒ± Basil is a fantastic "First Programming Language", but powerful enough to be used for anything.

ðŸŒ± Basil includes lots of sample programs including a complete Website Framework and MIDI DAW application.

ðŸŒ± Basil puts the power of AI in the hands of the student, hobbyist, and professional programmer.

ðŸŒ± Basil includes Built-in support ("Mods") for AI, Audio, MIDI, AWS (s3, ses, sqs, etc), CSV, CURL, JSON, SQL, Zip, Base64, PGP (encryption), REST, SFTP, SMTP and more

ðŸŒ± Basil includes the ability to have your favorite AI train itself on how to make Basil Library Objects ("Mods") and write Basil code.

ðŸŒ± Read the previous line again

ðŸŒ± Basil has a built-in ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for SQL databases.

ðŸŒ± Basil has a Rad 1980's GWBASIC interface if you want to use that. You can even instantiate Classes for manual testing, enter a program (with line numbers!) and run it, save it, load it, list it, and more. Cowabunga!

ðŸŒ± Basil has LOTS of documentation, examples, and a lot of old school and new school fun. 

ðŸŒ± Basil is inspired by Bob Zale's PowerBASIC and the warmth and simplicity of BASIC, 
but reimagined for today's developer needs with modern features, a robust standard library, 
and seamless interoperability with C and WebAssembly (WASI).

ðŸŒ± Basil is written in Rust for safety and performance, and aims to provide a delightful developer experience.

ðŸŒ± Basil is open source under the MIT or Apache-2.0 license.

ðŸŒ± Basil is a project by Blackrush LLC, Tarpon Springs, Florida, and written by Erik Olson.

ðŸŒ± Basil is pronounced like "basil" the herb, and is a pun volcano.




### Quick Try:

ðŸŒ¿ Running a basil program without rebuilding the VM:

```terminal
target/release/basilc run examples/hello.basil
# or
target/debug/basilc run examples/hello.basil
```

Building and deploying Basil to run CGI scripts on Linux:

```
cargo build --release -p basilc
install -m 0755 target/release/basilc /usr/lib/cgi-bin/basil.cgi
```

ðŸŒ¿ Running a basil program with a bunch of libraries

```terminal
cargo run -q -p basilc --features "obj-curl obj-zip obj-base64" -- run examples/zip_demo.basil
```

ðŸŒ¿ Running a basil program with a full build (all libraries) (Recommended)

```terminal
cargo run -q -p basilc --features obj-all -- run examples/objects.basil
```

# ðŸŒ± Basil Prototype v0 â€” Public Plan & Skeleton

A minimal, publicâ€‘ready blueprint for a modern BASICâ€‘flavored language focused on web/backâ€‘end. This plan targets a tiny, endâ€‘toâ€‘end slice: **source â†’ tokens â†’ Abstract Syntax Tree â†’ bytecode â†’ VM** with room to evolve into C/WASM/JS backends.

---



## 0) Highâ€‘level goals

* ðŸŒ± **Developer joy**: BASIC warmth + modern features (expressions, async later, modules).
* ðŸŒ± **Simple core now, room to grow**: start with a stack VM, evolve to register/SSA.
* ðŸŒ± **Interop first**: design a stable C Application Binary Interface (ABI) and WASI component boundary (later phases).
* ðŸŒ± **Linux + Windows, single binary toolchain**.

---

## 1) ðŸŒ± Repository layout (Rust host)

(BADLY needs to be updated)

### Complete list of Basil Feature Objects (Mods). You can link them individually or all at once with --features obj-all (Recommended)

At build time, you can enable any of the following mods.  You can also enable all of them at once with --features obj-all.

Enabling more mods will increase the size of the Basil binary, but will give you more functionality.
