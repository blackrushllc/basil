Idea: Given my background (PowerBASIC, Evo/BozoL), I want to design a modern, BASIC-flavored language that’s pleasant to read yet first-class for web + backend. Below is a practical blueprint—what to build in, how to compile/run, and how to make extensions and ecosystem leverage a strength rather than a liability.

## TL;DR

* Implement in **Rust**.
* Ship **three codegen targets** early: **C emitter**, **WASM/WASI**, and optional **Node/JS emitter**.
* Make extensions easy via **C ABI** and **WASI plugins**; add **N-API** and **HPy** bridges for ecosystem leverage.
* Deliver a **great HTTP story** plus a **cargo-like toolchain** right away.
* Keep BASIC’s readability but adopt modern features (async/await, modules, gradual types, pattern matching).


# 1) Implementation stack (host language + backends)

**Host implementation language**

* **Rust**: best all-around choice today—great cross-platform tooling, memory safety, embeds easily, solid async (Tokio), mature bindings to LLVM/Cranelift/Wasmtime.
* Alternatives: **Zig** (excellent C interop, tiny toolchain), **C++** (max control, but more foot-guns), **Go** (fast iteration, but CGO/FFI friction and GC stalls you don’t control).

**Code generation strategy**

* **Tiered backends from day 1**:

    * **WASM/WASI** (via *Cranelift* or *LLVM*): gives you browser + edge + server portability, sandboxed extensions, and a crisp “system ABI” (WASI Preview 2).
    * **C emitter** (like Nim or Zig’s concept in reverse): compile to C for wide portability, trivial interop with C libraries, and quick bootstrapping of native targets.
    * **Node/JS emitter** (optional but powerful): for immediate leverage of npm and easy SSR/edge deployment.
    * Optional later: **native AOT** via LLVM for hot paths and CLI tools.

This trio (WASM, C, Node) gives you: browser, server, embedded, and “compile almost anywhere” on day 1 without maintaining a single monolithic JIT.

# 2) Runtime design (the part that makes or breaks adoption)

**Memory management**

* Keep BASIC ergonomics but modern safety: use **precise, generational GC** with **arenas/regions** for request-scoped objects (web handlers). Offer **FFI handles** (opaque, ref-counted) for foreign resources.
* Permit “**no-GC zones**” (e.g., inside FFI calls) and **manual arenas** for high-performance sections.

**Concurrency & async**

* Make **async/await** a first-class feature with a **libuv-class event loop** abstraction.
* Offer both **structured concurrency** (task scopes, cancellation) and an **actor model** (mailboxes) for supervised services.
* Ensure a clear **sync boundary** for extension authors (no unexpected thread re-entry).

**Error model**

* BASIC-friendly `TRY … CATCH … FINALLY`, but also provide an ergonomic **Result** type so library authors can avoid exceptions on hot paths.

# 3) Modules, packages, and versioning

* Design a **Cargo-like package manager** from the start: `basil.toml` (or your language’s name), semantic versioning, lockfiles, reproducible builds.
* **Two module kinds**:

    1. **Pure** (compiles to any backend).
    2. **Native** (targets C ABI or WASI; includes prebuilt artifacts per platform).
* Add **capabilities** in metadata: which OS/CPU/backends/FFIs a package supports.
* Include **vendoring** and **checksums** (corporate users will ask immediately).

# 4) Extension & ecosystem strategy (our biggest leverage)

Think of extensions in **tiers**, so authors can pick the easiest viable path:

**Tier A — FFI to C Application Binary Interface (ABI) (fastest route to “big ecosystem”)**

* Provide a stable **C Application Binary Interface (ABI)** for host ↔ extension. If you can call C, you can call **SQLite, OpenSSL, libxml2, libcurl**, etc., and—via shims—tap **existing PHP/Python/Ruby/Perl** native libs.
* Ship **binding generators** (like cbindgen/bindgen) and a **header-only SDK** for native modules.

**Tier B — WASI plugins (safe, portable)**

* Allow loading **WASM modules** as plugins; pass values via **WIT** (Component Model). Sandboxed, cross-platform, great for SaaS and “upload your plugin” stories.

**Tier C — Polyglot interop shims**

* **Node/N-API** bridge: import Node packages as modules, with a marshalling layer for buffers, streams, async functions.
* **Python HPy/limited-ABI** bridge: call into Python wheels that use the **stable ABI**; this instantly unlocks NumPy/Pandas/science via a microserver or in-process when safe.
* **PHP FFI** (server-side only) for talking to PHP extensions from your runtime (handy in mixed stacks).

*Rule of thumb*: prefer **process isolation** for heavy foreign runtimes (Python/Node) with a **fast IPC** (UDS/SHM), and reserve in-process bridges for N-API and C/WASI modules.

# 5) Language & standard library shape

**Syntax**

* Keep BASIC warmth (readability, friendly keywords), but adopt:

    * **Expressions everywhere**, **function/closure literals**, **namespaces**, **modules**, **imports**, **pipe/forward operators**.
    * **Gradual typing**: dynamic by default; optional types with local inference. Add **algebraic data types** and **pattern matching** (modern, but can be sugar for structs/enums).
    * **String/JSON literals** with interpolation and **built-in datetime/decimal** types.

**Stdlib (web-first)**

* HTTP(S) client/server, JSON/CBOR/YAML, dotenv/config, logging, tracing, crypto (TLS, hashing, JWT), database drivers (start with SQLite + Postgres), filesystem, subprocess, async utilities, testing.
* Define **one canonical HTTP handler interface** (like WSGI/Rack/PSR-7) so frameworks and servers interoperate.

# 6) Web story (first-class)

* **Batteries-included HTTP server** with middleware stack (routing, body parsing, cookies, sessions, CORS, templating).
* **PSR/Rack/WSGI-style compatibility layers** so apps can be portable (even generate adapters to run in Node/Express, Deno, or as a CGI/FastCGI).
* **Edge-ready**: target **WASI HTTP** so the same handler can run on Cloudflare Workers, Fastly, or Wasmtime.

# 7) Tooling from day one (developer delight)

* **Single binary** that includes: REPL, build, test, fmt, lsp, doc gen.
* **LSP** for editor integration, **formatter** (no bikeshedding), **fast test runner**, **time-travel debugger** for async code (killer feature).
* **Project templates**: `basil new web`, `basil new lib`, `basil new wasm-plugin`.

# 8) Performance plan

* Start with **bytecode VM** (register-based like LuaJIT) for fast iteration.
* Add **AOT to C** for dev builds and portability; **AOT to native** (LLVM) where speed matters.
* For WASM: use **Cranelift** JIT when embedding, else AOT with `wasm-opt`.
* Hot functions: `@inline`, `@no_alloc`, `@unsafe` escape hatches; **arena allocators** for predictable request lifetimes.

# 9) Governance & compatibility

* **Stable language edition** every 12 months; **rust-style “editions”** to allow evolution without breakage.
* **Stable plugin ABI** with feature flags (query at runtime). **Semantic versioning** for the ABI.
* Clear **security model** (capability-based I/O, least privilege, signed packages).

# 10) A realistic 12-month roadmap (cut to ship)

**Phase 0 (weeks 0–4)**

* Parser (Pratt), AST, minimal type checker scaffold, interpreter for expressions/statements. Built-in strings, arrays, maps.

**Phase 1 (weeks 5–12)**

* Bytecode VM, GC v1, stdlib: fs, net sockets, timers, HTTP client. Package manager skeleton.

**Phase 2 (weeks 13–20)**

* Async runtime, HTTP server + middleware, SQLite driver, templating, test runner, formatter, LSP prototype.

**Phase 3 (weeks 21–32)**

* C emitter (portable AOT), FFI (C Application Binary Interface), WASI target for modules, simple N-API bridge. CLI “one binary” polish.

**Phase 4 (weeks 33–48)**

* Postgres driver, auth/crypto, logging/tracing, first web framework (routes/middleware/ORM-lite), docs site, examples. Preview release.

**Phase 5 (weeks 49–52)**

* Stability pass on Application Binary Interface (ABI), pkg index, “hello-CRUD” starter, perf tuning, 1.0 beta.

# 11) Pitfalls to avoid

* **Unstable ABI** for extensions—pick one (C + WASI) and freeze it early.
* “Yet another package format” with no mirrors—host a **static index** anyone can mirror.
* Over-promising JIT speed—focus on *predictable* performance, easy profiling, and native/WASM escape hatches.
* Neglecting Windows—treat Windows as a first-class target (file paths, sockets, TLS stores, services).
